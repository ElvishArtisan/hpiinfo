MANDATORY PREREQUISITES
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
You will need the following installed and configured properly on your 
system before building GlassCoder:

Qt6 Toolkit, v6.2.4 or better (http://www.qt.io/).

AudioScience HPI (ASIHPI), v4.00 or later.  Advanced audio API for using
the line of professional, high-end audio cards from AudioScience Corporation.

INSTALLATION
Once the prerequisites are set up, building and installation of the code is
done by cd'ing to the top of the source tree and typing './configure
[options]', 'make', followed (as root) by 'make install'.  Those who
obtained the source via CVS will need to do './autogen.sh' first.  There
are a number of options for the 'configure' script; do './configure --help'
for a detailed list.
